									Study complex phase behavior of anisotropic nanoparticles and colloidal building blocks with the aid of computer simulations: Self-assembly is a governing principle by which materials form. Self-assembling processes are common throughout nature and technology. A revolution in novel nanoparticles and colloidal building blocks has brought new excitement to the field. Self-assembly of these new building blocks beyond molecules, which is mainly based on selective control of non-covalent interactions, makes self-assembly reaches new heights. Here, we mainly develop suitable models to simulate hierarchical self-assembly of these anisotropic building blocks such as disklike micelles, rodlike micelles, patchy particles and so on, and then control over precise and predictable self-assembled structures across the scales and understand the mechanistic details of self-assembly processes. We envisage such hierarchical self-assembly of soft anisotropic particles will be of great potential in electronic, optical, optoelectronic device, drug delivery and biological applications including mimic hierarchical self-assembly in biology.<br>

									Vesicles are important three dimensional assemblies. They have attracted much attention in the fields of biology, chemistry, and physics, because they may serve as the prototype of bio-cells, and be designed to play important role in drug and gene delivery. Vesicle formed from natural phospholipids is similar to cell membrane, which has been comprehensively studied in bio-modeling; Chemists are attracted by special reactive condition provided by vesicle and hope to realize the control of reaction. Using DPD method we find that block copolymer with special structure can form vesicle in suitable solvent environment. Using parallel DPD we reveal a new pathway of vesicle fusion with spontaneous mode. We will try to study the fission processing and find the factors that affect vesicle behaviors, and realize the control of vesicle formation and transition in future. <br>

									My current research mainly focuses on the computer simulation study of polymerization by the coarse grained DPD and MD method. As is known, there is a competition between phase separation which is demixing the different species and the polymerization which is mixing the particles. This topic relates to the material processing in industry: the reactive injection molding (RIM) technology is widely used. However, accompanied with the reactions, phase separation may take place in the mold, which will strongly affect the mechanical properties of the final products. Therefore, it is very necessary to study the coupling between the two dynamic processes. Besides, I have developed a special practical method of avoiding bond crossing in 2d-DPD, in which a two dimensional geometry constraint condition and a kind of mathematically analytic geometry method has been originated to solve this problem. This approach is proved can be used in any simulation models when they are aimed to study the two dimensional polymer systems with long chain lengths. Recently, I am developing the simulation of the surface initiated polymerization by the truncated-shifted Lennard-Jones potential and FENE bond force, mainly focusing on the polymerization rate effect on the growth of surface tethered polymer brushes. In this system, the simulation result implies that polymerization rate and initiator density together determine the density of the polymer brushes. The denser polymer brushes have to suffer the excluded volume effect obviously. All of the conclusions may give a general advice to industrial preparation of polymer brushes.<br>
                                    I wish to extend my research to the influences of shearing, the molecular structures and the multi-type reactions on the spinodal decomposition, and the effect of the competition between microphase separation of block copolymers and the macrophase separation of polymer blends. In the future, simulation study of the generation of polymers with complicated structures will be carried out, e.g., the polymerization of hyper-branched or cross-linked polymers. Besides, some special processes such as chemically degradation, generation the molecules with ligands or with hydrogen bond will be taken into account. Also, advanced work in extending the methods to bio-systems is of great interest to him.<br>

									Structure and dynamic evolution of polymers at surface or interface are studied in this project. The configurations and dynamics of polymer chains at and near solid surfaces differ profoundly from that in the bulk. If polymer chains with well-defined length adsorbed onto solid substrate, well-ordered assembled monolayer could be prepared. Conjugated molecules are the most common candidates and they can be used in active electronic and optoelectronic organic materials. Many techniques could prepare thin uniform polymer films. However, dewetting will take place if a partially wetting film is placed on a solid substrate. Therefore it is of much importance to study the stability of the adsorbed polymer thin film. Another promising building block to self-assemble into highly ordered structures is rod-coil block copolymers. The local packing of rigid rod gives rise to additional orientational ordering within the self-assembled structures. It is interesting to balance the competition between maximizing the rod-rod contacts and the entropy contributed by the coils, and hence to prepare electronic and optoelectronic materials in nanoscale. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation method is adopted to probe the laws inherent in the above-mentioned physical processes. Besides traditional explicit MD simulation method, coarse-grained molecular dynamics (CGMD) method which ignores the chemical detail of atoms and therefore can provide physical quality in large time and space scale is also adopt. In my work, we investigated not only the adsorption of single-chain polystyrene on the graphite surface and the self-assembly of permethyldecasilane on silicon surface using atomistic MD method, but also the dewetting behavior of liquid film on partial wetting solid surface and the self-assembly of tethered nanorods using CGMD method. Recently, our interest is focused on the influence of “reaction” on the dynamic self-assembly of rigid rod system.<br>

									1. The dynamic behavior of DPD fluids coupled with reversible reaction: Many practical problems such as morphology control in materials science are related to the phase separation. The reversible reaction in the fluids may seriously affect the morphology patterns and the dynamic behavior of fluids. There may be a competition between the phase separation and the reversible reaction. The influences of various factors, including the reaction probabilities and the viscosities of the components, on the phase separation pattern formations are considered.<br> 
                                    2. DPD simulation for the structure of associating polymers: Associating polymers are flexible macromolecules which were formed by the telechelic polymers. These molecules are of immense technological importance, primarily as viscosity modifiers, in a wide range of applications, including coatings, pharmaceuticals, bio-medical fluids and personal care products. DPD simulation is able to provide further insights into the dynamical microstructure and its relationship to the physical properties. This part of work is ongoing.<br>

									Microphase ordering in block copolymers and mesophase formation in thermotropic liquid crystals are two examples of phenomena that manifest themselves primarily on mesoscopic length- and time-scale. Both processes occur in a large class of liquid crystal molecules and polymers and a large amount of experiments had been carried out to validate these processes.<br>
                                    Fifty years ago, Onsager showed that long rod-like particles, interacting only through excluded-volume interactions, form a nematic phase upon increasing the density. Many liquid crystal phase have been nominated from the experiments. But the reason for the diversity of the phases is still mysterious to us. Since then, many computer simulations of liquid-crystal behavior had been performed using hard-core model such as spherocylinders and the Gay-Berne potential.<br>
                                    DPD, which is a robust tool for us to investigate condensed soft matter systems, (including polymer, nano-particle & polymer and colloid), gives us a semi-quantitative coincidence with the theory for the location of phase transition. This simulation method, may help us to unveil the nature of the phenomena to some extents.<br>

									The dynamics by which a flexible molecule such as DNA crosses a membrane through a nanoscopic channel is of great interest to understand several biological mechanisms. For example, this type of translocation process is involved in DNA replication and in the mechanism of virus infection of a cell nucleus. The translocation of flexible molecules through nanopores could lead to several applications, such as the fast DNA sequencing, gene therapy, and controlled drug delivery. However, the physics of constrained macromolecules and the fluid that surrounds them at the nanoscopic scale is still not well understood. <br>
                                    We use Molecular Dynamics simulations and milestoning with explicit solvent to study the impact of hydrodynamic interactions on the translocation time of a polymer. We study the the scaling of the translocation time with the polymer chain length, and the effect of the size of pore radius with the translocation time.<br>

									Physical gelation in polymer solution is studied in this project. Sol-gel transition behavior is influenced strongly by polymer solution properties. In order to describe the physical gelation behavior in polymer solution clearly, at first, polymer solution properties have to be understood deeply. Although the theoretical and experimental researches in polymer solution have been an important subject since the polymer science was set up, the physics essence and physical process of some important problems are still not clear enough, especially for the understand of the complex behavior of biomolecular solution system, the theoretical description in tradition polymer solutions considering solvent structure and size, and so on.<br>
                                    Physical gelation in polymer solution is sensitive to so many factors that experiments are difficult to cover all the possible events and theoretical approximation is difficult to provide quite exact forecast and description, so computer simulation becomes a very important means in the researches of physical gelation in polymer solution. Considering this, my working project combines the DPD simulation technique and some experimental methods to study the physical gelation in polymer solution, focusing on the configuration of polymer chains, aggregates sizes and their size distributions, sol-gel phase diagrams and other aspects.<br> 
                                    Recently, the system in our research is aqueous solution of triblock copolymers of the polyethylene oxide-polypropylene oxide-polyethylene oxide. Experimental techniques used are: small-angle neutron scattering (SANS), small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), fluorescence spectrum, dynamic differential scanning (DSC), static and dynamic light scattering and rheology. At the same time, the mechanism of the gelation of the solution of PEO-PPO-PEO is studied using the simulation method of DPD.<br>

									1. The charge transport properties of the organic molecules crystal: In the past decade, organic electroluminescent materials have become a fascinating field in the world for their diverse potential applications in communication, information, and flat-panel displays. The consideration of the full periodicity is very important for a proper description of electronic properties of organic molecular crystals. We intend to use Prof. Oganov’s program to predict organic crystal structures, because the program is better than Polymorph based on Monte Carlo method. We then use quantum mechanical (QM) methods to interpret the charge transport properties of the organic molecules crystal. Our approach is illustrated by a band-like model in which we examine the transfer integral with the first principles. We also simulate the organic structures at various values of temperature and pressure via the molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The theoretical studies show that it can greatly modulate and improve the electronic and optical properties of the light-emitting materials by modification of chemical structures. Also, it can help to understand the microscopic electroluminescent mechanism of the novel light-emitting materials by exploring their structure-property relations.<br>
									2. Bridging the gap between micro- and mesoscales by developing multiscale simulation techniques:Free-radical polymerization is an important and well-established process for the production of polyethylene. The reaction mechanism, the dynamical properties, and rate constants play significant role for free-radical polymerization. Propagation is the main reaction to increase chain length, in which long chain radical add to unsaturated bonds of the monomers. The chain-length dependence of the propagation rate coefficient for the free-radical polymerization is investigated on an ab initio basis. Moreover, we can also take into account the macroscopic phase behavior of the materials. We are trying to combine molecular dynamics (MD) and Monte Carlo (MC) to obtain the behavior of the chain propagation process. This can lead to better insight and optimization of the current production process.<br>

									1. Ordered packing of elliptical particle in 2-dimension:Self-assembly is a governing principle by which materials form. The patterns arising from self-assembly are ubiquitous in nature. The elliptical particle can self-assemble into crystals (nematic or sematic structure), because of its anisotropic interactions. We use a modified dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) by adopting an anisotropic repulsive potential on the basis of the conservative potential in DPD. We obtained sorts of structures through controlling the shape of the particles, the angular width of the repulsion and the strength of the repulsion.<br>
									2. A single chain of multiblock copolymer self-assemble into patchy particle:Patchy particle is of interest in a wide variety of fields from materials science to biology. How can we improve the yield in materials synthesis to get the structure that we want? How do proteins in a cell come together to form complex structures with high accuracy?  Patchy particles are of interest significance to both these questions. We use coarse-grained molecular dynamics (CGMD) and DPD method to study the behaviors of a single multiblock copolymer chain forming into the patchy particle in poor solvent. We can get some patchy particles of well symmetry by controlling the proportion of the components, the chain length, the property of the solvent, and interactions of the particles.<br>
